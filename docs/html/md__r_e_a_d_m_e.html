<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>This exercise was implemented using C++11. A couple of extras were added beyond what is mentioned in the original documentation below. They help to make the implementation a better example of modern software development.</p>
<p>First the exercise was built using test-driven development (see "Unit Tests/counter_test.cpp). The framework used was the Boost Unit Test Framework. This is freely available and popular with many C++ developers. It only affects the above mentioned file. No Boost libraries were used in the actual implementation code.</p>
<p>Second, some extra class methods (and non-class methods) were added to make the classes "smart" to work with. This includes move constructors, move assignment operators, and swap for most of the classes. Copy constructors and copy assignment operators were deleted because file streams can't be copied. There was not time to add unit tests for these extras however. These extras were also not added to the Counter class because it is a Singleton (Design Pattern).</p>
<p>Note further that the implemenation widely uses the RAII principle (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) as encouraged by Bjarne Stroustrup, the maker of the C++ language. All new/deletes and file open/closes are hidden in constructor/destructor methods.</p>
<p>The Single Responsibility Principle of the SOLID software development principles was also followed. For example string utility functions were separated out into their own file (<a class="el" href="_string__utils_8hpp.html">String_utils.hpp</a>/cpp), instead of included in the File_token_counter class.</p>
<h3>Original Exercise Documentation</h3>
<p>Using C++, write a program to do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open a file specified as the first parameter on the command-line that contains a list of filenames, one filename per line.</li>
<li>For each filename in the list, read each file and tokenize the contents. a. Tokenizing for this problem is defined as separating the file into words (characters delimited by whitespace), stripping leading and trailing punctuation, and forcing the token to be lowercase.</li>
<li>Output a file specified by the second parameter on the command line containing a list of total unique tokens and their count, each on a separate line, sorted by frequency.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, if the first file (input.txt) contained a single line:</p>
<p>test.txt</p>
<p>And that file contained the text: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">This is only a test. A *very* short test!</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Running the program: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./counter input.txt output.txt</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Would result in an output file (output.txt) that looks like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">a 2</div><div class="line">test 2</div><div class="line">is 1</div><div class="line">only 1</div><div class="line">short 1</div><div class="line">this 1</div><div class="line">very 1</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>You can use STL, but avoid usage of third-party libraries. Note that although the above example is frequency and alphabetically sorted, only frequency sorting is required. For purposes of this problem, you can assume all valid input files will be UTF-8 encoded English text. Use Doxygen-style function documentation.</p>
<p>You should approach this project as you would if you worked at a company in terms of quality, style, and performance. </p>
